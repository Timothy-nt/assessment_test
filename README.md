Assessments Q1

Explanation:

The program starts by creating a Scanner object to read user input.
The main method calls the getValidInput method to get a positive integer from the user.
The getValidInput method repeatedly prompts the user for input until a valid positive integer is entered. It catches NumberFormatException if the input cannot be parsed as an integer.
Once a valid input is obtained, the printFibonacciSequence method is called to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number.
The printFibonacciSequence method uses a while loop to generate and print the Fibonacci numbers. It starts with previous set to 0 and current set to 1.
In each iteration of the loop, it prints the current number, calculates the next number by adding previous and current, and updates previous and current accordingly.
The loop continues until the current number exceeds the given input number.
Finally, the program closes the Scanner object.
The program handles invalid input by displaying appropriate error messages and asking the user to enter a valid positive integer. It also ensures modularity by separating the input validation and Fibonacci sequence generation into separate methods

Explanation:

The function findLargestDifference takes a List<Integer> as input and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list.
The function first checks if the list has less than two elements. In such cases, it returns 0 since there are not enough numbers to calculate a difference.
The function initializes min as the first number in the list and maxDiff as the difference between the second number and the first number.
It then iterates through the list starting from the second element.
In each iteration, it calculates the difference between the current number and the minimum number seen so far (diff).
If the calculated difference is greater than the current maximum difference (maxDiff), it updates maxDiff accordingly.
If the current number is less than the current minimum number (min), it updates min to the current number.
After iterating through the entire list, the function returns the maximum difference found.
This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list. It handles lists of any size and accounts for duplicates. It also handles the edge case of a list with less than two elements by returning 0.

  Explanation:

The query uses the SELECT statement to retrieve data from the "employees" table.
The * symbol after SELECT specifies that all columns should be selected. You can replace * with specific column names if you only need certain columns.
The FROM keyword indicates the table from which the data is retrieved, in this case, "employees".
The WHERE clause is used to specify the conditions that the employees must meet. In this case, we have two conditions: age > 30 and salary > 50000.
The AND operator combines the two conditions, ensuring that both conditions must be true for an employee to be selected.
The result of the query will be all rows from the "employees" table where the age is above 30 and the salary is above $50,000.
The query is straightforward, easy to understand, and maintains good readability. It efficiently filters the data based on the specified conditions.

Assessments Q4

The bug in the code is related to the calculation of the average. The code currently performs integer division, which truncates the decimal part of the result. To fix this, we need to change the division operation to perform floating-point division.
To fix the bug, we need to cast total to a double before performing the division. By casting total to double, the division operation will result in floating-point division instead of integer division. This ensures that the decimal part of the average is preserved.
In the corrected code, the line double average = (double) total / numbers.length; performs the necessary floating-point division. The (double) casts the total to a double before the division is performed.
The corrected code is well-structured, modular, and readable. It addresses the bug by using floating-point division to calculate the average correctly
